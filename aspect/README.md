Run the script "install-aspect-spack.sh" in this directory to install aspect and all its
dependencies on Anvil.

The script has detailed instructions about how to install. Please read the instructions in
the script first.

Due to some bug in the aspect build procedures, spack is currently not able to install
aspect automatically. You will need to edit the "links.txt" file manually and install it
in a hybrid fashion.

Follow the steps outlined in the script.
